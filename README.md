# Pulpo

Graph visualization appliacation based on fork from Retina (https://gitlab.com/ouestware/retina)

## How to contribute

Retina was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

It uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styles, and is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for its base styles and its grid system, and [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for icons.

Finally, the graphs are rendered using [sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org/) and [graphology](https://graphology.github.io/).
